# STM32-GPSDO_build
PCB for the 'Yet another GPSDO' project by AndrewBCN at EEVblog.com

This repository is a place to share the Diptrace schematic and PCB design for the 10MHz GPSDO designed by AndrewBCN.
This project is documented and discussed at: https://www.eevblog.com/forum/projects/yet-another-diy-gpsdo-yes-another-one/

The PCB is designed to fit into a common 100 x 76 x 35 mm extruded aluminum project that is commonly available on eBay:

The blank endpanels for the case are replaced with custom designed PCB panels with cutouts for the BNC jacks, GPS antenna, power, etc.
